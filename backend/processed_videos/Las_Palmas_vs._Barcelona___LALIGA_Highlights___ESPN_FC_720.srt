1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,980
And this is the starting lineup for Diego Martinez and Blasparmas as you mentioned defense has been there a kill is here

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,240
Will there be Marmo moving inside to play alongside Alex Sware is the captain at center back

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,839
Jenny the last Palmer starting lineup Alex what do you make of Barcelona's starting lineup today most of the changes for

4
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,839
Handsy flick in recent weeks have come in the center back pairing five different center back pairings in the last five games today

5
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,280
It's Kubasi and Eric Garcia

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:35,120
Only did the things to fix what was going wrong for last Palmer's early on and they seem to have turned a corner

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,719
But I mentioned the Christmas a new year break

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,799
Perhaps coming at the wrong time for last Palmer's because they haven't been the same team since

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,120
That's free kick for the visitors

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,240
We've gone 12 games on beat now in all competitions since the break it was

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
Kunde only half away

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:05,280
Only entirely relieving the pressure Maledo picking up the pieces for the home team and then a shot from distance which Shesney is not able to claim and

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
But Bernie

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Was there an offside flag there may have been choice in goal

15
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,480
Yeah, offside the moment that

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,760
Budget he takes the shot Mac burr the last Palmer's defense already looking under duress here

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,079
It's an ominous start for them in the header over the top on the angle leaning back rather

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,520
unlikely move from Sheffield United

19
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,040
It's in in his direction couldn't get a touch on it the follow-up shot is a decent one

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,400
Shesney always confident it was asking just why did the goal that

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
It was a good effort by BT and

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,560
This is what you need to do if you're if you're the last Palmer's defender you need to finish the thing producing assists

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
reading yes

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,040
Now that the flags staying down for now, but for how long is the question of Sunday?

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
And

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
And gets the shot away Shesney

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
There's a decent one he turned it behind

28
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,159
You've got the high line of Barcelona. Sandro is coming from behind having a lot of side

29
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,040
But it's sandroll the one who gets the ball. It's a very similar move

30
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,439
Has peeled away into some space Kunde cost to meet him

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,439
Here's Alberto Maledo cutting inside getting the shot away

32
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,439
Probably three or four feet wide in the end

33
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:46,719
Maledo's quality right footer player on the left he will always cut inside and tried to open an angle from shooting

34
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,000
He tried to adjust it to the far post he went wide, but this is yet another

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Of course a team that never

36
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,520
A huge amount of money to spend they got some defensive concern here as Barcelona

37
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,800
Time made the most of this Raffinia and they didn't quite do that did he

38
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,039
Basit working the

39
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,159
Corner short the cross eventually arriving. It's a good hook away. Wasn't it my asu go

40
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,000
Facing his own goal, but it breaks kindly here and the shot is on

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,280
The medium out may have been a fraction offside

42
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,919
No, it's badger these playing everyone on site

43
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:39,039
It was not only for him to to try to head it, but also to call the attention of the defenders are clearing this pace for our teammates

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,199
It's getting more and more involved. Does not you know now he's found Danny holmo

45
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,199
It's absolutely brilliant

46
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:54,639
Just like that they slice last Parmas open and Danny holmo

47
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,039
Is ended his own personal gold route in some style

48
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,639
Ability to operating tight spaces and he's the one that started the counter attack La Min Yamaha just

49
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,519
Connecting with him in tight spaces and this

50
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,639
This triple against Alex Bunoz

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,639
Just changing the ball from the right to the left

52
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,639
And then smashing in into the crossbar

53
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,719
Nothing to do for Jasper Silicent what a goal. This is

54
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,680
Danny almost quality the ability to receive the ball with one foot to switch it

55
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,959
To the other and he had been able with technically the weaker foot

56
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,240
To send these shots absolutely brilliant by Danny Omo

57
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,639
These it sharp challenge there on Alex Munoz the left back which

58
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,960
For his ignored allowing an advantage to play as a Sandro from distance

59
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,480
Well, they don't Danny Omo just sprinting into space

60
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:24,360
Providing a platform now for Balda and Rafini out feeding in towards the far post and Yamal got there

61
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,920
But the angle was too tight drolet

62
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,199
Beautifully done by Barcelona beating the high press that last bomb as word Trent

63
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,759
That means you'd have used his right foot

64
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,560
But it's all Barcelona at the moment last Parmas looking fairly ragged all of a sudden the back at Levit Dorsky unable to punish them

65
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,720
For the knockout punch on they 20 minutes to go

66
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,840
They really deserve it and look at the difference with Laminia Malin the first half and in the second half just

67
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
paul Barci is also

68
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,040
A part of shabby's plan of injecting more players into the first team

69
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Now Balda is trying to live in Dorsky

70
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,600
Any bank left footed over the top

71
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,639
No, I'm sorry. I don't know. Yeah exactly. Beatty was playing him on site

72
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:23,639
All right, this isn't Sandro trying to produce a Luminium Alcross and teach us can for handball. They are the referee thinking about it

73
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
And what's he gonna do here

74
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,599
But it's almost as if he was gonna give the penalty and then realize that last Parmas

75
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,039
Was still on the attack and that a chance might unfold. Half is the question

76
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,199
I had the same impression as you

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,399
Maybe there's an offside

78
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Is there a Garcia I think who yeah, they're appealing for the handball against what does a handball by Alex Wattip here

79
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,439
Yeah, and then

80
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
He hits the back of our of eddie

81
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,439
I

82
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,879
Are gonna see a last man back. This is what we want to see. This is the crucial question

83
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,759
To answer

84
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,639
Again still happy to just to shield possession of the attacking third 11 dosky will chase that down but not get there

85
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,879
That's a loose clearance and a chance to finish it

86
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,439
Ferrant Torres is not just that

87
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,719
Another ice cold splendid finish from Barcelona

88
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:51,319
That cross by Marquez AdÃ³ let's give some love and some recognition to Rafinha 95 minutes into the game and he's still

89
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,199
Helping out the team defending chasing balls and that one touch pass makes the difference because

90
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,439
Ferrant Torres touch is too heavy. It's not a good reception

91
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,159
But then he makes the most of it with his left foot smashing it

92
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,920
Into the crossbar same as Danny Omo did to secure Barcelona

93
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,199
For this game

94
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,000
And see flick

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,599
Won't be celebrating but his team Alex are back on chop of the pile

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,760
They make knocked off

97
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,160
Briefly as it turns out by athletic overdrip

98
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,159
The rivals are opponents of the cup race semi finals on Tuesday. So that gives them an extra confidence boost

99
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,840
Danny Omo ending his draw and becoming the MVP

100
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,000
Hansi flick with a perfect reading of the game and and making those substitutions

101
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,320
Good game good second half of Barcelona great three points and

102
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,120
At this point in performance again by last time
